# Crystallist: Rank and share your favorite games

Crystallist is a web app for ranking games and sharing your list with friends. It relies heavily on the wonderful [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) package.

## Features

- Drag-and-drop interface that works on desktop and mobile
- Easily share your list via the share button or by copying the full URL (the query string updates to reflect list state)
- Keyboard navigation is also available â€” tab to select an item, space to "grab" or "release" it, and arrow keys to move it up and down the list
